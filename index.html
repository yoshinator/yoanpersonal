      <h2> Welcome to my page</h2> <h2>A little bit about me:</h2> <p>Briefly, I am an explant that emigrated from Cuba when I was a child in pursuit of the American dream</p>
      <p> I'm now a web developer that is passionate about solving business problems with code. I was introduced to programming in the early 2000s and decided to pursue that career in 2008. Before that I was a member of the U.S Air Force enlisting after the events of September 11th curtailing my career for about 8 years. During this time I juggled school and military life. After my service I owned a small business which I sold until 2018 to continue my career as a software developer. I'm a skilled teacher, mentor and life long learner humbled by vastness of what I don't know.</br><hr /><span class="alternate">Get to know more about or contact me by clicking one of the links on the left of the page.</span></p>

      <p class="project-details">Deployed on Heroku with a Google Cloud storage bucket attached to Active Storage for images and sitemaps. Home On Call is a Ruby on Rails application that uses Tiny MCE for text editing and Action Mailer for important emails sent to customers and clients when they take certain actions. It has an admin backend complete  with 9 models to create a content management system that auto creates local content from templates. Jquery and Javascript is used for multistep forms and to give admin users feedback about the content they write. I leveraged the use of layouts, custom model methods and applied the Law of Demeter to keep my controllers as skinny possible. I also used helper modules to customize content by creating unique pages through a "muxer" that creates custom content based on city and service in database. The Google Places and Google Maps API was used to create fresh dynamic content on each of those pages. I took cost into consideration and minized my use of the apis by storing the responses as json objects in the backend. This application is a CMS for business service listings using the latest in SEO markup techniques to rank highly on search engines.</p>
