    <p>Hi, </br>I'm Yoan. I love to code, ride my motorcycle and to hang out in nature. I was a small business owner for 6 years. I'm also a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. I sold my business in 2018 and decided to pursue a career as a software developer. I really enjoy learning and helping people. I love going to the movies but mainly for the popcorn and soda. I'm currently open to opportunities as a junior software developer. </br><hr /><span class="alternate">Getting in touch with me is easy.
